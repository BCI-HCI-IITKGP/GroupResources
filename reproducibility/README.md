# Reproducibility

Our group strives to do science as openly and reproducibly as we can. We
recognize that there can be limitations in nuclear because of export control
and occasional non-disclosure agreements, but within those confines we will
follow these practices:

*   Store data in an open access repository like [figshare](http://figshare.com/) 
    or [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org), possibly as soon as it's collected,
    and given its own [Digital Object Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) (DOI).
    Or store published data somewhere like [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/).
*   Version control work in a repository, hosted on GitHub or BitBucket if
    possible.
*   Conduct analysis with version-controled scripts; post the scripts in the
    repository.
*   Use an open repository for publications associated with the work.
*   When happy with the state of the publication, post a version to 
    [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) or some other preprint server to invite feedback 
    from peers (incorporate feedback as necessary).
*   The published paper includes links to the preprint
    and code and data repositories.

Some things to think about in terms of reproducibility:
* What versions of third party libraries and support software were required?
* What operating system did you use?
* Make sure to version control output or include timestamps so it can be mapped
  to exact code versions.  

[This short article](http://www.bitss.org/2015/12/31/science-is-show-me-not-trust-me/) 
by [Philip Stark] (http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/) provides a good
checklist for guiding the reproducibility of your work.

[This short guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) from
GitHub explains how to create a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for your code,
 your papers, or anything else hosted in a version control repository.
