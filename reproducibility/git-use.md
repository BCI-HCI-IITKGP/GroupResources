### GitHub collaboration practices

1) Do not issue a pull request into `master` or `dev` unless the testing code
coverage is the same or increasing (by fraction). 

2) Pull requests must be reviewed by someone other than the author before
merging.
When submitting a PR, tag someone to do said review and merge.
If requested reviewer cannot perform review for some reason, tag someone else. 

3) Test framework must pass for code to be merged. 

4) Use GitHub issues to request features / development needs. Tag someone as
needed. 
PRs should then reference issues and/or milestones.
