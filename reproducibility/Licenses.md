# Licenses

Very closely related to Licenses is [Reproducibility and Open
Science](./README.md).

All work in our group should include a `LICENSE` file in the base directory of
the repository that clearly states under which license the content is being
made available.

Note that code and writing without a license is implicitly under copyright
protection and is _not_ freely available.  

Two resources that are useful for identifying what license you'd like to use:
- for code, I like this [Choose a License](http://choosealicense.com/); I
  usually choose a BSD or MIT license. The linked site gives you fillable
  versions of the licenses. 
- for writing, [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) is a 
  good resource. I usually simply ask for attribution.
