This is an example of how to set up recurring meeting page for
discussions with Rachel. The idea is that before we have our meeting each week
(in person or virtual), each student will update their meeting page. I will
check the page *after you email me that it's ready*, but before our meetings. 

Goals of the page:
- one place to look for current progress of research
- links to all relevant material
- one place to look for finding major items when preparing reports, papers, etc.

What should go in here:
- things you want me to know about: e.g. major updates, developments,
  conclusions
- things you need action on
- links to materials supporting your research: e.g. repos in which you're
  conducting your research, presentations, papers
- consider that if I need to pull together a report or talk highlighting your
  research, wouldn't it be great if I could just find everything and not have to
bother you :-)?

This should help us have more effective meetings. It will also create a record
of progress as well as one place to look for information. It is probably a good
idea to have a research repository, and this be one item in that repository. You
can even link to the repo from the GroupResources SlaybaughLab repo if you want
to.

### Update 2016/07/13

Major update: I found out x about y; here's a link to the plot. 

Goals for the trip:
* **Not Completed** Work on writing some of my thesis 
  * Note: I did actually work on writing, but I didn't get even close to the amount I was 
  expecting to, so I don't consider this completed. To make up for the work I've missed, I plan 
  on working on the weekend this coming weekend. 
* **Attempted** Try and debug the rebuild, if possible. 

Goals for the upcoming week:
* Prepare for interviews
