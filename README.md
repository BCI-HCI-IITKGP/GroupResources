# GroupResources
A common place to compile resources of use to the research group

For Spring 2016 we will have weekly group lunches from 12:00 up to as late as
2:00 on Wednesdays in BIDS 190-B. The first meeting will be March 2. The last 
Wednesday of each month will be a group meeting about research progress and
skill collaboration, the first of which will be March 30. 

[General Resources](./general-resources/) is a folder that contains general
resource information on tools and software that the group uses frequently. This
includes LaTeX, primers for software packages, information on using Savio, our
HPC system at UC Berkeley, and best practices in software development. 

[Paperwork](./paperwork/) is a folder with pertinent paperwork that you will
need to complete to fulfill various requirements for your academic pathway,
whether that be your Master's, PhD, Postdoc, or Staff Position. 

[Reproducibility](./reproducibility/) contains information about best practices
to conduct computational science responsibly and reproducibly. This research
group is committed to following these principles to the best of our ability.

[Templates](./templates/) is a folder containing templates for conference
papers, theses, posters, and whatever else. It's a menagerie of template types
and files!  

[I,Librarian](./ilibrarian/) contains information about the group's shared reference
manager/repository. Currently it has the presentation used to guide the training
given on 08/24/16; full guidelines and a tutorial will follow soon.
