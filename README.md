# GroupResources
A common place to compile resources of use to the research group

For Spring 2016 we will have weekly group lunches from 12:00 up to as late as
2:00 on Wednesdays. The last Wednesday of each month will be a group hack
session, the first of which will be March 30. 

[General Resources](./general-resources/) is a folder that contains general
resource information on tools and software that the group uses frequently. This
includes LaTeX, primers for software packages, information on using Savio, our
HPC system at UC Berkeley, and best practices in software development. 

[Paperwork](./paperwork/) is a folder with pertinent paperwork that you will
need to complete to fufill various requirements for your academic pathway,
whether that be your Master's, PhD, Postdoc, or Staff Position. 

[Group Members](./group-members/) contains information on each group member.
This information should help guide you in seeking out which group member might
be a useful point of contact for a piece of software you'll be using. 

[Meeting Notes](./meeting-notes/) contains notes from our monthly group
hackathons. 

[Templates](./templates/) is a folder containing templates for conference
papers, theses, posters, and whatever else. It's a menagrie of template types
and files!
