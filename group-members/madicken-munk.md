# Madicken Munk

### Quick info: ###

I know this stuff:
* Python 2.7 / 3.0
* MCNP
* Make/CMake (basic level)
* LaTeX 
* Building software on Savio
* Building Exnihilo
* Running software on HPC systems
* Bash
* Software development practices
* git/github (but I know nothing about Mercurial)


### Various repo links, etc.:###

* [My personal website](http://munkm.github.io/)
* [My github page](https://github.com/munkm)
* [The cask model project repo](https://github.com/munkm/caskmodels)
* [The **super secret** cask model repo](https://github.com/munkm/caskmodels_private)
* [My Papers repo](https://github.com/munkm/Papers) -- this contains the .tex files of papers I have written or are currently writing. 


### Software with which I work: ###

* I am developing a hybrid deterministic/Monte Carlo method.
  * I am implementing this method in software packages developed at ORNL.
    * Denovo / Exnihilo
    * ADVANTG

* I am familiar and have proficiency with using the following software:
  * Denovo
  * ADVANTG
  * MCNP5/MCNPX/MCNP6
  * Other things I'll add later.

### Systems on which I develop and use: ###

* I primarily develop software on my 2015 MacBook Pro
* The vast majority of my work is in Python 2.7
* I run my problems on my macbook or our HPC system, Savio. [Here is the user guide](http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/user-guide)


### Tools I like to use: ###

* Add more later

### Projects on which I've worked: ###

* Parametric studies of small FHR systems **MCNP, ORIGEN, BEAU**
* Estimating radiation-induced stress of FHR central reflector **MCNP, COMSOL**
* Design of a neutron source for Ar/Ar age-dating applications in SPACE!!! **MCNP**
* Development of a hybrid method for problems with strong angular anisotropies (see above for more specific development info)

### Other fun things: ###

I like cats.
