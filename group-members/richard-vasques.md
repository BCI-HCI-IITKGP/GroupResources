### Quick info: ###

I am a Mathematician, so let's start with the theory... I can help with:

* ODE's and PDE's
* Stochastic Processes and Probability
* Asymptotic Analysis
* Integral Equations
* Linear Algebra and Spectral Analysis
* Real and Complex Analysis
* Functional Analysis and Measure Theory (a little rusted...)
* Deterministic and Monte Carlo algorithms

On the practical side, I also can help with:

* LaTex
* Matlab
* Fortran
* Python (basics...)
* git/github (basics...)
* ...

### Other fun things: ###

I also like cats.
