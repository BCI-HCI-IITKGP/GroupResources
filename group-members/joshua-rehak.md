# Joshua Rehak

### Quick info: ###

Software I use routinely or have experience with (in order of amount
of use):
- Emacs
- git
- Serpent (and Serpent 2)
- MCNP

Languages I work with:
- LaTeX
- R
- C
- Python (2.7 and 3.0)
- Bash
- Lisp
- SQL
- VisualBasic for Applications (ug, don't ask)

Things I can help with:
- Setting up SSH keys for use with github (really, you need to do this
  right now).
- Installation of various Linux distributions
- Linux troubleshooting
- Setting up MOOSE (I haven't used it for real though)

### Various repo links, etc.: ###

- [My github page](https://github.com/jsrehak)
- [Some study guides I've made](https://github.com/jsrehak/studyGuides)
- I'm also the webmaster for the neutronics site: link to follow.

### Systems on which I develop and use: ###

I do a majority of my work on my Lenovo laptop running ArchLinux. I've
used any number of Linux distributions and I'd be happy to help anyone
get started with picking and using one.

### Tools I like to use: ###

- Slack: even though no one else seems to like using it.
- Emacs: I've spent a while developing a deployable emacs.d file, so I
  can go anywhere, clone my emacs.d and on startup it will download
  the required packages from MELPA and get everything set up for
  me. [repo](https://github.com/jsrehak/emacs.d)
- Vim: But only because it's still running on my computer because I
  can't figure out how to exit it.


### Projects: ###

Development and implementation of a weighted delta-tracking scheme in
Serpent 2.

### Other fun things: ###

I like hiking and dogs, amoung other things.
