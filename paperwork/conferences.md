### Conference Travel booking and reimbursement
---------------

Probably the best way is to follow the Cal directions
[here](http://travel.berkeley.edu/book-trip). What is below is at least some of
what works beyond that; it might not be the most efficient. 

For most items below, you can either purchase it and be reimbursed, or we can
follow a procedure such that it can be paid for ahead of time.

#### flights
- fill out a [direct bill id request form](./DirectBillIDRequestForm.pdf) and send to prof slaybaugh
- choose a flight and send details to prof slaybaugh
- prof slaybaugh will get your flight through the UC system

alternative: purchase yourself

#### registration
- fill out the conference registration form and take a screenshot of each
  filled-out page (if applicable). Do not actually register
- send these to prof slaybaugh
- a grants officer will register on your behalf

alternative: purchase yourself

#### other transport
- save reciepts
- file with reimbursement form afterwards

#### food
- save recipets
- file with reimbursement form afterwards

#### hotel
- save recipet
- file with reimbursement form afterwards


Once you've completed the trip, collect pertinent information and follow the
[reimbsursement](./reimbursements.md) directions.
