#Savio

Savio is the name of UC Berkeley's institutional/condo cluster.

##Getting Started 

To first get started, you need an account on the Savio computer. This can be done by asking one of the
neutronics faculty members about it, and it may take a week or so for the account to be activated.

Once your account is in place, you will need to install the Pledge software, used for logging into Savio.

Instructions for installing Pledge can be found here: http://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/logging-savio

**Note:** you may want to install Pledge on multiple devices such as your computer(s) as well as your
smartphone; this will make it easier to install and verify Pledge on a new machine in the future should
the need arise.

Once you've installed Pledge, everything else regarding Savio is fairly similar to using any other 
computing cluster.

##SLURM

On Savio, jobs are submitted through and handled with SLURM (Simple Linux Utility Resource Manager).
