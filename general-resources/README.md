# General Resources

This is a folder that contains general
resource information on tools and software that the group uses frequently. This
includes LaTeX, primers for software packages, information on using Savio, our
HPC system at UC Berkeley, and best practices in software development. 

[The TeX page](./tex.md) is a good place to start if you're getting started
with LaTeX.

Software Carpentry (we will add info later) is a place with links and tips if
you're new to software development, or if you'd like a refresher on best
practices.

[Savio](./savio.md) is a place with information on getting started on our HPC system. 

[Abacus](./abacus.md) contains information about our group's sever.

Codes and Software is a place with links for documentation on the software we
use and develop.
