# Course Selection

Here are some courses that could be useful for you all to take, separated by
category.

## Applied Math (Math)

### Definitely Useful

bounds, iteration methods, least square approximation, eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of matrices, nonlinear equations, and minimization of functions.

equations; Boundary value problem; Eigenvalue problem; Discretization
