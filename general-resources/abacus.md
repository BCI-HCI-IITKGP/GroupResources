#Abacus

Abacus is the name of our group's cluster.

Cluster address: `abacus.berkeley.edu`

##Getting Started 

To first get started, you need an account on the computer. 
Email Professor Slaybaugh, Josh, or Kelly (the administators) for an account.

##Software
If you'd like to install a piece of software on the cluster, let one of the
administrators know. 
They will create a group for that piece of software and add the appropriate
users.
Then
- You can create a folder (code name and version) in `/home/software` with the correct group permission.
- Place the source code for the software in that location. 

Note: all users on our sever will be put in the `comp-n` group. 
If you'd like to make something available to everyone, please set the group to
`comp-n`.

**need:** 
* basic directions for chmod and permission management
* directions for software installation and management (where to install and
 build).
